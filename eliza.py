'''The following list, "List", contains all the regular expressions that the program tries to match with the input given by the user. 
The items mentioned first in the list have a higher priority than the items mentioned later, as the program stops as soon as it finds a match.
If no match is found and the program reaches the end of the list, it matches the sentence to the regular expression ".*?", as this
regular expression can match with any sentence. It then gives a list of generic responses as it has found no match, such as 
"Go on.", "Do you enjoy your classes?", "That's interesting.", etc. It also brings up topics from the past conversation by asking specifically about the 
major of the student, and mentioning their name in the conversation.
"%1" has been used in the sample outputs to show that the user input will be transformed and given as the output there. For example,
if the input "I want to know how I can get good marks" is given by the student, it will match the regular expression "I want to know (.*?)(\.|!|,)".
The output chosen may then be "Why do you want to know %1?". The code will then replace %1 with "how I can get good marks" after transforming it and changing it
to "how you can get good marks". So the final response given by the program will be "Why do you want to know how you can get good marks?"
If "%2" is present in the list of possible responses, it will be replaced by the student's major when the program uses it as a response. 
If "%3" is present in the list of possible responses, it will be replaced by the student's name when the program uses it as a response.
